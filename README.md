   - Trigger on Consultant: Creates a Past Information record when a consultant with type as an employee is inserted. Prevents deletion of a consultant record with type as an employee and status as approved.
   - Trigger on Past Information: Throws an error when attempting to delete a Past Information record related to a consultant with type as an employee and status as approved.

5. **Test Classes**

   - Developed test classes for triggers, and Apex Controllers with 100% code coverage.
   - Created a Test Utility class containing methods to create test data for testing purposes.

6. **Lightning Web Components (LWC)**

   - Developed 2 LWC components to display related Consultant and Client information on the Past Information and Project record detail page respectively using `lightning-record-form`
   - Developed 4 LWC components to display and search Consultant, Client, Project, and Training records using `lightning-datatable` and by fetching data using Apex Controllers using the modern `async await` JavaScript Syntax instead of using `@wire` adapter.
   - Implemented infinite scrolling to efficiently load and display all records using the `enable-infinite-loading` attribute of `lightning-datatable` base component.
   - Integrated `lightning-modal` components released in Winter'23 which are triggered by action buttons on the above 4 LWC components to create new records.

7. **LWC Modal Components**
   - Created modal components for Consultant, Client, Project, and Training records using `lightning-modal` base component which contained `lightning-record-edit-form` to create records.
   - Enabled the Save button to save records efficiently using `createRecord(recordInput)` method from `lightning/uiRecordApi`.
   - Enabled the Cancel button to close the Modal component.
